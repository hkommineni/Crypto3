Week 3 assignment contains 3 parts:
Part 1: to decrypt the given cipher text using ECB and this logic is present in aesInEcb()
Part 2: One of line in ciphertext uses ECB mode. Code in detectEcb() detects which one and print that line number.
Part 3: pkcsPadding() implements PKCS7 padding in AES.

Padding for "NO PAIN NO GAIN!" is "NO PAIN NO GAIN!\x10\x10\x10\x10\x10\x10\x10\x10\x10\x10\x10\x10\x10\x10\x10\x10"
Since "NO PAIN NO GAIN!" pad to 128 bits. It contains exactly the 16 bytes so hexadecimal x10 is addpended 16 times to the padded output.

week3.py includes all the three parts and executes on a single run. Used Python 2.7.
