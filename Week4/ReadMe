Week 4 assignment contains 2 parts and goes on a single run, used Python 2.7

Implementing CBC mode covers in aesInCbc()
Detecting ECB/CBC modes covers in detectEcbOrCbc()

Sometimes ECB mode go undetected because there may be a case where one block of cipher text after encoding may not be equal to another block.

Output:
C:\Python27\python.exe C:/Users/hkommineni/PycharmProjects/Crypto/Week4/week4.py
 AES in Cipher Block Chaining Mode, this program implements CBC mode using earlier ECB function.
So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

I never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
Nothing else matters

Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us, something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know, yeah!

So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
No, nothing else matters
